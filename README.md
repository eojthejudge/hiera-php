Hiera implemented in PHP
======

## What is Hiera?
According to the [Hiera website](http://docs.puppetlabs.com/hiera/):

    Hiera is a key/value lookup tool for configuration data.
    
Hiera uses a configurable hierarchy to enable "Cascading Configuration".

It's great for infrastructure configuration (which is why it's used in Puppet),
but it also applies to multi-tenancy applications.
